                <p>n writing, the words point and purpose are almost synonymous. Your point is your purpose, and how you
                    decide to make your point clear to your reader is also your purpose. Writers have a point and a
                    purpose
                    for every paragraph that they create.</p>
            </div>

                <P>Writers write descriptive paragraphs because their purpose is to describe something. Their point is
                    that
                    something is beautiful or disgusting or strangely intriguing. Writers write persuasive and argument
                    paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or convince someone. Their point is that their
                    reader
                    should see things a particular way and possibly take action on that new way of seeing things.
                    Writers
                    write paragraphs of comparison because the comparison will make their point clear to their readers.
